# processing-snad
A Java-based art project for the Processing graphical library involving particle simulations, inspired from sandspiel.club and the incredibly well-made Noita video game.

This is merely just a proof-of-concept, I plan on directly using an OpenGL library with either Python or Java to create this in the near future instead of Processing due to performance.
