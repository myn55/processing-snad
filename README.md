# processing-snad
A Java-based art project for the Processing graphical library involving particle simulations, inspired from sandspiel.club and the incredibly well-made Noita video game.

This is merely just a proof-of-concept, I plan on directly using an OpenGL library with either Python or Java to create this in the near future instead of Processing due to performance.

If you want to try this out for yourself, download Processing from [https://processing.org/download](https://processing.org/download), make a new sketch, and copy and paste the code from `main.java` into the sketch. Press run, and have fun! (Keybinds are written at the top of the code)
